I need to find the side length of the hexagon.\n\nHmm, okay, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, it's a convex hexagon, so all its interior angles are less than 180 degrees.

The problem says that if we extend the sides AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle with side lengths 200, 240, and 300.

However, all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. That pr",
