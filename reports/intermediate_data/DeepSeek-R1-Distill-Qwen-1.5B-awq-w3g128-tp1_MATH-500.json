By symmetry (the gecko and the fly are exactly opposite each other in the room), the path length is the same if the gecko only travels along the back wall and side walls.\n\nNow suppose the gecko only travels along the ceiling and side walls. These walls unfolded become: [asy]\ndraw( (0,0)--(8,0)--(8,10)--(0,10)--cycle ); draw( (8,0)--(20,0) ); draw( (8,10)--(20,10) );\ndraw( (20,0)--(28,0)--(28,10)--(20,10)--cycle );\npair g = (21,9); pair f = (1,1);\ndot(g, green); dot(f, purple);\ndraw(g--f, red);\ndraw(f--(21,1), red+dashed); draw(g--(21,1), red+dashed);\nlabel( \"8\", (0,0)--(8,0) ); label( \"12\", (8,0)--(20,0) ); label( \"8\", (20,0)--(28,0) ); label( \"10\", (28,0)--(28,10) );\n[/asy] The path is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs 8 and 20, so its length is $\\sqrt{8^2 + 20^2} = 2\\sqrt{4^2+10^2} = 2\\sqrt{116}$. (We'll keep it in this form because it makes it easier to compare with the other cases.)\n\nFinally, the gecko may cross both the ceiling and front wall (or back wall; the cases give the same results by symmetry). The unfolded walls then look like this: [asy]\ndraw( (0,0)--(10,0)--(10,8)--(0,8)--cycle );\ndraw( (10,0)--(22,0)--(22,8)--(10,8)--(10,18)--(22,18) );\ndraw( (22,8)--(30,8)--(30,18)--(22,18)--cycle );\npair g = (23,17); pair f = (9,1);\ndot(g, green); dot(f, purple);\ndraw(g--f, red);\ndraw(f--(23,1), red+dashed); draw(g--(23,1), red+dashed);\nlabel(\"10\", (0,0)--(10,0)); label(\"12\", (10,0)--(22,0)); label(\"8\", (0,0)--(0,8), W);\n\nlabel(\"8\", (22,18)--(30,18), N); label(\"10\", (30,18)--(30,8), E);\n[/asy] The path is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs 16 and 14, so its length is $\\sqrt{16^2+14^2} = 2\\sqrt{8^2+7^2} = 2\\sqrt{113}$. Of the three cases, this is the smallest, so the answer is $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{113}}$."

This tells us that $QS$ passes through $R$.

Thus, $a > 0.$\n\nFor $a > 0,$ the line portion of the graph passes through all horizontal lines with height less than or equal to $a^2+2a,$ and the parabola portion of the graph passes through all horizontal lines with height greater than or equal to $a^3.$ Therefore, all horizontal lines are covered if and only if \\[a^2 + 2a \\ge a^3.\\]Since $ a > 0,$ we can divide by $a$ to get \\[a + 2 \\ge a^2,\\]so $0 \\ge a^2 - a - 2 = (a-2) ( a+1).$ This means that $-1 \\le a \\le 2,$ so the greatest possible value of $a$ is $\\boxed{2}.$\n\nThe graph of $y = f(x)$ for $a = 2$ is shown below (not to scale); note how the parabola and line meet at one point: [asy]\nsize(8cm);\nimport graph;\n\nreal a =2;\ndraw((-5,0)--(6,0),EndArrow());\ndraw((0,-6)--(0,14),EndArrow());\n\nreal g(real x) {return 0.5*a*(x-a)^2+a^3;}\nreal f(real x) {return a*x+2*a;}\n\ndraw(graph(f,-4.6,a),BeginArrow());\ndraw(graph(g,a,4.5),EndArrow());\n\nlabel(\"$f(x)$\",(0,15.5));\nlabel(\"$x$\",(6,0),E);\ndot((2,8));\n[/asy]"

Now, we want $7b + 53 > 200$, so as a result, $b > \\frac{200-53}{7} \\implies b > 21$. Therefore, we want an integer greater than 21 which leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 8.

The base of the triangle has length $x$. To find the altitude, we notice that drawing an altitude splits the equilateral triangle into two $30-60-90$ triangles with the longest side having length $x$. Since the ratio of the side lengths of a $30-60-90$ triangle is $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$, the altitude will have length $\\frac{x\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and the area of the triangle will be $\\frac{1}{2}x\\left(\\frac{x\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)=\\frac{x^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}$. Setting this equal to $16 \\sqrt{3}$, we have that $\\frac{x^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}=16\\sqrt{3}.$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get that $x=8$. Since the side length of the triangle is $8$ and the square and triangle have equal perimeters, the square has a side length of $\\frac{8 \\cdot 3}{4}=6$. If we draw the diagonal of the square, we notice that it splits the square into two $45-45-90$ triangles with legs of length $6$.

The area of the unshaded portion of the inner circle is thus $\\frac x{360}$ of the total area of the inner circle, or $\\frac x{360}(\\pi(1^2)) = \\frac x{360} \\pi$ (since $\\angle ADC$ is $\\frac x{360}$ of the largest possible central angle ($360^\\circ$)).\n\nThe area of shaded portion of the inner circle is thus $$\\pi - \\frac x{360}\\pi = \\frac{360 - x}{360}\\pi.$$ The total area of the outer ring is the difference of the areas of the outer and inner circles, or $\\pi(2^2) - \\pi(1^2) = 3\\pi$. The shaded region of the outer ring will be $\\frac x{360}$ of this total area. So the shaded region of the outer ring is $\\frac x{360} (3\\pi) = \\frac{3x}{360}\\pi$.\n\nSo the total shaded area (which must equal $\\frac53 \\pi$) is, in terms of $x$, $$\\frac{3x}{360} \\pi + \\frac{360 - x}{360} \\pi = \\frac{360 + 2x}{360} \\pi.$$ Therefore, $$\\frac{360 + 2x}{360} = \\frac53 = \\frac{600}{360},$$ so $360 + 2x = 600$, or $x = \\boxed{120}$."

Therefore, $p^n$ has $n+1$ different positive divisors, and the only positive integers with exactly three positive divisors are the squares of prime numbers.\n\nThe five smallest such integers are, in ascending order, $2^2$, $3^2$, $5^2$, $7^2$, and $11^2$. The fifth number listed is $11^2=\\boxed{121}$."

        "Intuitively, $x$ will be largest for the option for which the value in the parentheses is smallest.\n\nFormally, first note that each of the values in parentheses is larger than $1$. Now, each of the options is of the form $3f(r)^x = 7$. This can be rewritten as $x\\log f(r) = \\log\\frac 73$. As $f(r)>1$, we have $\\log f(r)>0$. Thus $x$ is the largest for the option for which $\\log f(r)$ is smallest. As $\\log f(r)$ is an increasing function, this is the option for which $f(r)$ is smallest.\n\nWe now get the following easier problem: Given that $0<r<3$, find the smallest value in the set $\\{ 1+r, 1+r/10, 1+2r, 1+\\sqrt r, 1+1/r\\}$.\n\nClearly, $1+r/10$ is smaller than the first and the third option.\n\nWe have $r^2 < 10$, so dividing both sides by $10r$, we get $r/10 < 1/r$.\n\nFinally, $r/100 < 1$, therefore $r^2/100 < r$. Since both sides are positive, we can take the square root and get $r/10 < \\sqrt r$.\n\nThus the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(B)}} 3(1 + r/10)^x = 7$."

        "The number $f^{-1}(0)$ is the value of $x$ such that $f(x) = 0$.  Since the function $f$ is defined piecewise, to find this value, we must consider both cases $x \\le 3$ and $x > 3$.\n\nIf $x \\le 3$ and $f(x) = 0$, then $3 - x = 0$, which leads to $x = 3$.  Note that this value satisfies the condition $x \\le 3$.  If $x > 3$ and $f(x) = 0$, then $-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0$.  This equation factors as $-x(x - 3)(x + 1) = 0$, so $x = 0$, $x = 3$, or $x = -1$.  But none of these values satisfies $x > 3$, so the solution is $x = 3$, which means $f^{-1}(0) = 3$.\n\nNow we compute $f^{-1}(6)$, which is the value of $x$ such that $f(x) = 6$.\n\nIf $x \\le 3$ and $f(x) = 6$, then $3 - x = 6$, which leads to $x = -3$.  Note that this value satisfies the condition $x \\le 3$.  If $x > 3$ and $f(x) = 6$, then $-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6$, or $x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0$.  This equation factors as $(x - 2)(x^2 - 3) = 0$, so $x = 2$, $x = \\sqrt{3}$, or $x = -\\sqrt{3}$.  But none of these values satisfies $x > 3$, so the solution is $x = -3$, which means $f^{-1}(6) = -3$.\n\nTherefore, $f^{-1}(0)+f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = \\boxed{0}$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(3mm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.7pt)+fontsize(8pt));\nimport graph;\n\ndraw((-20,0)--(20,0),Arrows(4));\ndraw((0,-20)--(0,20),Arrows(4));\n\nreal f(real x) {return 3-x;}\nreal g(real x) {return -x^3+2x^2+3x;}\n\nreal x;\n\ndraw(graph(f,-15,3),BeginArrow(4));\ndraw(graph(g,3,4),EndArrow(4));\n\nreal eps = 0.2;\n\ndraw((-eps,3)--(eps,3));\ndraw((-eps,0)--(eps,0));\ndraw((-eps,-3)--(eps,-3));\n\ndot(\"$(-3,6)$\",(-3,6),SW);\ndot(\"$(3,0)$\",(3,0),NE);\n\nlabel(\"$f(x)$\",(3,20.5));\nlabel(\"$x$\",(20.5,-1));\n[/asy]"

For the first case, note that if $x+5$ and $3x-6$ have the same sign, then $x+5=3x-6$:\n\nCase 1: \\begin{align*} x+5&=3x-6\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad -2x&=-11\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad x&=\\frac{11}{2}\n\\end{align*}If we plug this value of $x$ back into the original equation to check our answer, we get that $\\left|\\frac{11}{2}+5\\right|-\\left|3\\left(\\frac{11}{2}\\right)-6\\right|=0$ or $0=0$. Since this is true, we can accept $x=\\frac{11}{2}$ as a valid solution.\n\nFor case two, note that if $x+5$ has a different sign than $3x-6$, then $x+5=-(3x-6)$.\n\nCase 2: \\begin{align*} x+5&=-(3x-6)\n\\\\ x+5&=-3x+6\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad 4x&=1\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad x&=\\frac{1}{4}\n\\end{align*}If we plug this value of $x$ back into the original equation to check our answer, we get that $\\left|\\frac{1}{4}+5\\right|-\\left|3\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)-6\\right|=0$, which also gives us $0=0$. This is always true, so we can accept $x=\\frac{1}{4}$ as a valid solution as well. Thus, our two possible solutions are $\\frac{1}{4}$ and $\\frac{11}{2}$.

        "Employing the elementary symmetric polynomials ($s_1 = \\alpha_1+\\alpha_2+\\alpha_3+\\alpha_4 = -2$, $s_2 = \\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_1\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4 = 0$, $s_3 = \\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3\\alpha_4 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_4\\alpha_1\\alpha_2 = 0$, and $s_4 = \\alpha_1\\alpha_2\\alpha_3\\alpha_4 = 2$) we consider the polynomial \\[\nP(x) = (x-(\\alpha_1\\alpha_2+\\alpha_3\\alpha_4))(x-(\\alpha_1\\alpha_3+\\alpha_2\\alpha_4))(x-(\\alpha_1\\alpha_4+\\alpha_2\\alpha_3))\n\\]Because $P$ is symmetric with respect to $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4$, we can express the coefficients of its expanded form in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials.  We compute \\begin{eqnarray*}\nP(x) & = & x^3 - s_2x^2 + (s_3s_1-4s_4)x + (-s_3^2-s_4s_1^2+s_4s_2) \\\\\n& = & x^3 - 8x - 8 \\\\\n& = & (x+2)(x^2-2x-4)\n\\end{eqnarray*}The roots of $P(x)$ are $-2$ and $1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\{1\\pm\\sqrt{5},-2\\}}.$\n\n$\\textbf{Remarks:}$ It is easy to find the coefficients of $x^2$ and $x$ by expansion, and the constant term can be computed without the complete expansion and decomposition of $(\\alpha_1\\alpha_2+\\alpha_3\\alpha_4)(\\alpha_1\\alpha_3+\\alpha_2\\alpha_4)(\\alpha_1\\alpha_4+\\alpha_2\\alpha_3)$ by noting that the only nonzero 6th degree expressions in $s_1, s_2, s_3,$ and $s_4$ are $s_1^6$ and $s_4s_1^2$. The general polynomial $P$ constructed here is called the cubic resolvent and arises in Galois theory."

The three given equations become \\begin{align*}\na+b&=d\\\\\n2a&=5c\\\\\n2a&=c+d\n\\end{align*} We want to find the value of $b$. We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to eliminate $a$, to get $5c=c+d \\Rightarrow 4c=d$. Since $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are all integers from 1 to 9, we know that $d$ must be either 4 or 8 and $c$ correspondingly either 1 or 2. The first case, $c=1$ and $d=4$, does not work because plugging those two values into the third given equation gives $2a=5$, which is impossible if $a$ is an integer. Thus, $c=2$ and $d=8$. Plugging these values into the third given equation to solve for $a$, we have $2a=2+8\\Rightarrow a=5$. Plugging $a=5$ and $d=8$ into the first equation to solve for $b$, we have $5+b=8 \\Rightarrow b=3$. Thus, the value of the square is $\\boxed{3}$."

        "By the distance formula, we are trying to minimize $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\\sqrt{x^2+\\frac{1}{4}x^4-9x^2+81}$. In general, minimization problems like this require calculus, but one optimization method that sometimes works is to try to complete the square.  Pulling out a factor of $\\frac{1}{4}$ from under the radical, we have \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{4x^2+x^4-36x^2+324}&=\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(x^4-32x^2+256)+68} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(x^2-16)^2+68}\n\\end{align*}This last expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, that is, when $x^2=16$. Then the distance is $\\frac{\\sqrt{68}}{2}=\\sqrt{17}$.  Hence the desired answer is $\\sqrt{17}^2 = \\boxed{17}$."

We can show this as such: $$|(10x + y) - (10y + x)| = 27.$$ However, it doesn't matter which of the two numbers is greater, since we wish to find their sum. So, without loss of generality, we will let the first number be the larger of the two. This means that $x > y,$ so we can get rid of the absolute values in our last equation to obtain $9x - 9y = 27,$ equivalent to $x - y = 3.$\n\nWe now have two equations in two variables: $x + y = 13$ and $x - y = 3.$ Adding the two, we obtain $2x = 16,$ so $x = 8.$ Subtracting, we obtain $2y = 10,$ so $y = 5.$ Thus, the original number is $85,$ and our answer is $85 + 58 = \\boxed{143}.$\n\nOR\n\nAs before, the two digit number can be expressed as $10x + y,$ and the number with its digits reversed is $10y + x.$ We want to find the sum of these two numbers, which is $$(10x + y) + (10y + x) = 11x + 11y = 11(x + y).$$ We are given that the sum of the digits is $13,$ so $x + y = 13.$ Since all we want is $11(x + y),$ we can substitute for $x + y$ to obtain our answer of $11\\cdot 13 = \\boxed{143}.$"

Similarly, letting $x=0$ gives $\\frac{y}{12} = 1$, so $y=12$, which means $b=12$.  There are several ways we can find the slope.  First, we could put the equation in slope-intercept form by subtracting $\\frac{x}{4}$ from both sides, and then multiplying by 12.  This gives $y = -3x +12$, which tells us that the slope is $-3$ (and confirms our solution for the $y$-intercept).  We also could have noted that since we have already shown that $(4,0)$ and $(0,12)$ are on the line, the slope of the line is $\\frac{12 -0}{0-4} = -3$.

Thus the parallelogram is composed of two triangles, each of which has area \\[\n9=\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot |c-d| \\cdot \\left|\\frac{c-d}{b-a}\\right|.\n\\]It follows that $(c-d)^2=18|b-a|$.\n\nBy a similar argument using the second parallelogram, $(c+d)^2=72|b-a|$. Subtracting the first equation from the second yields $4cd=54|b-a|$, so $2cd = 27|b-a|$. Thus $|b-a|$ is even, and $a+b$ is minimized when $\\{a,b\\}=\\{1,3\\}$. Also, $cd$ is a multiple of 27, and $c+d$ is minimized when $\\{c,d\\}=\\{3,9\\}$. Hence the smallest possible value of $a+b+c+d$ is $1+3+3+9=\\boxed{16}$.

If the vertex of the parabola is $(h,k)$, then the $x$-intercepts $(-7,0)$ and $(2,0)$ are symmetric around the line $x = h$, so $h = (-7 + 2)/2 = -5/2$.\n\nHence, the maximum value of $y = 4(x + 7)(2 - x)$ occurs at $x = -5/2$, in which case \\[y = 4 \\left( -\\frac{5}{2} + 7 \\right) \\left( 2 + \\frac{5}{2} \\right) = 4 \\cdot \\frac{9}{2} \\cdot \\frac{9}{2} = \\boxed{81}.\\] (Note that this is a maximum value, and not a minimum value, because the coefficient of $x^2$ in $y = 4(x + 7)(2 - x) = -4x^2 - 20x + 56$ is negative.)"

The probability that she wins the game on her third turn is $1/32,$ and in general, the probability that she wins the game on her $k^\\text{th}$ turn is $(1/2)^{2k-1}.$ Thus, the probability that Alice wins is an infinite geometric series with first term $1/2$ and common ratio $1/4.$ So, the probability that Alice wins the game is $$\\frac{\\frac12}{1-\\frac14} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}.$$OR\n\nNote that the only difference between the odds of Alice or Bob winning is who goes first. Because Bob goes second, the odds of him winning on his $k^\\text{th}$ flip is half of the odds that Alice wins on her $k^\\text{th}$ flip, since Alice must first get a tails before Bob gets a chance to win. Thus, if $a$ is Alice's chance of winning, and $b$ is Bob's chance of winning, then $a = 2b.$ Also, since someone must win, $a + b = 1.$ It follows that $a = 2/3$ and $b = 1/3,$ so Alice has a $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$ chance of winning the game."

        "Since $f(x)$ has integer coefficients, the Integer Root Theorem tells us that all integer roots of $f(x)$ must divide the constant term $66=2\\cdot 3\\cdot 11$. Thus, the possible integer roots of $f(x)$ are\n$$\\pm 1,~\\pm 2,~\\pm 3,~\\pm 6,~\\pm 11,~\\pm 22,~\\pm 33,~\\pm 66.$$Moreover, since we know that all roots of $f(x)$ are integers, we know that all roots of $f(x)$ appear in the list above.\n\nNow we apply Vieta's formulas. The product of the roots of $f(x)$ is $(-1)^n\\cdot\\frac{a_0}{a_n}$, which is $33$ or $-33$. Also, the sum of the roots is $-\\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}=-\\frac{a_{n-1}}2$. Thus, in order to minimize $|a_{n-1}|$, we should make the absolute value of the sum of the roots as small as possible, working under the constraint that the product of the roots must be $33$ or $-33$.\n\nWe now consider two cases.\n\nCase 1 is that one of $33,-33$ is a root, in which case the only other possible roots are $\\pm 1$. In this case, the absolute value of the sum of the roots is at least $32$.\n\nThe alternative, Case 2, is that one of $11,-11$ is a root and one of $3,-3$ is a root. Again, the only other possible roots are $\\pm 1$, so the absolute value of the sum of the roots is at least $11-3-1=7$, which is better than the result of Case 1. If the absolute value of the sum of the roots is $7$, then $|a_{n-1}|=7|a_n|=7\\cdot 2=14$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $|a_{n-1}|\\ge 14$, and we can check that equality is achieved by\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x) &= 2(x+11)(x-3)(x-1) \\\\\n&= 2x^3+14x^2-82x+66,\n\\end{align*}which has integer coefficients and integer roots.

This gives us\n\\[(2bm)^2 - 4(m^2 + 1)(b^2 - 2) = 0,\\]which simplifies to $b^2 = 2m^2 + 2.$\n\nSolving for $x$ in $y = mx + b,$ we get $x = \\frac{y - b}{m}.$  Substituting into $y^2 = 8x,$ we get\n\\[y^2 = \\frac{8y - 8b}{m},\\]so $my^2 - 8y + 8b = 0.$  Again, the discriminant of this quadratic will also be 0, so\n\\[64 - 4(m)(8b) = 0.\\]Hence, $bm = 2.$\n\nThen $b = \\frac{2}{m}.$  Substituting into $b^2 = 2m^2 + 2,$ we get\n\\[\\frac{4}{m^2} = 2m^2 + 2.\\]Then $4 = 2m^4 + 2m^2,$ so $m^4 + m^2 - 2 = 0.$  This factors as $(m^2 - 1)(m^2 + 2) = 0.$  Hence, $m^2 = 1,$ so $m = \\pm 1.$\n\nIf $m = 1,$ then $b = 2.$  If $m = -1,$ then $b = -2.$  Thus, the two tangents are $y = x + 2$ and $y = -x - 2.$\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.8 cm);\n\nreal upperparab (real x) {\n  return (sqrt(8*x));\n}\n\nreal lowerparab (real x) {\n  return (-sqrt(8*x));\n}\n\npair A, B, C, D;\n\nA = (-1,1);\nB = (2,4);\nC = (-1,-1);\nD = (2,-4);\n\ndraw(graph(upperparab,0,3));\ndraw(graph(lowerparab,0,3));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),sqrt(2)));\ndraw(interp(A,B,-0.2)--interp(A,B,1.2));\ndraw(interp(C,D,-0.2)--interp(C,D,1.2));\ndraw(A--C);\ndraw(B--D);\n\nlabel(\"$y = x + 2$\", interp(A,B,1.3), NE);\nlabel(\"$y = -x - 2$\", interp(C,D,1.3), SE);\n\ndot(A);\ndot(B);\ndot(C);\ndot(D);\n[/asy]\n\nWe look at the tangent $y = x + 2.$  Substituting into $x^2 + y^2 = 2,$ we get\n\\[x^2 + (x + 2)^2 = 2.\\]This simplifies to $x^2 + 2x + 1 = (x + 1)^2 = 0,$ so $x = -1.$  Hence, the tangent point on the circle is $(-1,1).$\n\nWe have that $x = y - 2.$  Substituting into $y^2 = 8x,$ we get\n\\[y^2 = 8(y - 2).\\]This simplifies to $(y - 4)^2 = 0,$ so $y = 4.$  Hence, the tangent point on the parabola is $(2,4).$\n\nBy symmetry, the other two tangent points are $(-1,-1)$ and $(2,-4).$\n\nThe quadrilateral in question is a trapezoid with bases 2 and 8, and height 3, so its area is $\\frac{2 + 8}{2} \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{15}.$"

There are 15 students taking all three, and 30 students in both physics and calculus, meaning there are $30 - 15 = 15$ students in just physics and calculus.  Similarly there are $60$ students in just chemistry and calculus, and $60$ in physics and chemistry.  Since there are $x$ students in physics and $15 + 15 + 60 = 90$ students taking physics along with other classes, $x - 90$ students are just taking physics.  Similarly, there are $2x - 135$ students taking just chemistry and $90$ students taking just calculus.  Knowing that there are 15 students not taking any of them, the sum of these eight categories is 360, the total number of people at the school:   \\[\n(x - 90) + (2x - 135) + 90 + 60 + 15 + 60 + 15 + 15 = 360.\n\\] We solve for $x$ and find that the number of physics students is $x = \\boxed{110}$."

        "Since $2^3=8$, we may convert between base 2 and base 8 representations by replacing each block of three digits in base 2 with its equivalent in base 8. In this case, we begin by noticing that the last three digits are worth $110_2=6_8$. The next block of three digits is $001_2=1_8$. Continuing, we find that the next two digits (moving right-to-left) are $101_2=5_8$ and $010_2=2_8$. Altogether, we find that $10101001110_{2}=\\boxed{2516_8}$."

For example, setting $x = 3$, we get $11C = -11$, so $C = -1$.  Setting $x = -8$, we get $-11D = -55$, so $D = 5$.  (This may not seem legitimate, because we are told that the given equation holds for all $x$ except $-8$ and $3.$  This tells us that the equation $C(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23$ holds for all $x$, except possibly $-8$ and 3.  However, both sides of this equation are polynomials, and if two polynomials are equal for an infinite number of values of $x$, then the two polynomials are equal for all values of $x$.  Hence, we can substitute any value we wish to into this equation.)\n\nTherefore, $CD = (-1) \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{-5}$."

        "Let $P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 5.$  The remainder $R(x)$ has degree at most 1, so let $R(x) = cx + d.$\n\nWhen $P(x)$ is divided by $(x - 1)(x - 4),$ the quotient is of the form $x + p,$ so write\n\\[P(x) = (x + p)(x - 1)(x - 4) + R(x) = (x + p)(x - 1)(x - 4) + cx + d.\\]Comparing the coefficients of $x^2,$ we get $a = p - 5.$\n\nWhen $P(x)$ is divided by $(x - 2)(x - 3),$ the quotient is of the form $x + q,$ so write\n\\[P(x) = (x + q)(x - 2)(x - 3) + 2R(x) = (x + q)(x - 2)(x - 3) + 2(cx + d).\\]Comparing the coefficients of $x^2,$ we get $a = q - 5.$  Hence, $p = q.$\n\nComparing the coefficients of $x$ in both equations, we get\n\\begin{align*}\nb &= c - 5p + 4, \\\\\nb &= 2c - 5p + 6.\n\\end{align*}Subtracting these equations, we get $c + 2 = 0,$ so $c = -2.$\n\nComparing the constant coefficients in the first equation, we get $5 = 4p + d.$  Therefore,\n\\[P(5) = (5 + p)(4)(1) - 10 + d = 10 + 4p + d = \\boxed{15}.\\]"
